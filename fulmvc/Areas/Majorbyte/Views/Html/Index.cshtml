        <p>The article element represents a component of a page that consists of a self-contained 
        composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is intended to be 
        independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication. This could be a forum post, 
        a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive 
        widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.</p>
